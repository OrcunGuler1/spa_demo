This is a demo project assignment for a SPA the code is fully functional and responsive. Data is stored in a .json file but can be accessed via a web interface.

# After downloading open the console and type:
##  npm install
This will download all the necessary packages from npm servers.

# After all the required packages are installed install this one more package by typing the following command to console:
## **run  npm  i  -g  json-server**
This will download json-server package which will provide a dummy database created from a .json file.

# Once all the installations are complete;
In the console type **json-server --watch db.json** this will start the mock database and you're almost ready to go!

# Last step open the console and type:
## npm start

This step may ask for permission to run on another port depending on which command you've put in first between **json-server --watch db.json** and **npm start**

And you're up and running!
